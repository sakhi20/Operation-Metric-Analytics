## 🗂️ Case Study 1: Job Data Analysis

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| A. Jobs Reviewed Over Time | Calculate jobs reviewed per hour each day |
| B. Throughput Analysis | Use 7-day rolling average to track event rates |
| C. Language Share | Analyze language percentage over 30 days |
| D. Duplicate Detection | Identify duplicate `job_id` entries |

## 📈 Case Study 2: Investigating Metric Spikes

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| A. Weekly User Engagement | Count distinct active users per week |
| B. User Growth | Calculate cumulative weekly growth of active users |
| C. Weekly Retention | Track signup retention using cohort analysis |
| D. Engagement by Device | Segment user activity by device type |
| E. Email Engagement | Analyze open & click-through rates from email logs |

## 💡 Key Insights

- 📅 **Jobs Reviewed Over Time:** Identified hourly review trends to spot bottlenecks  
- 📈 **7-Day Throughput:** Provided smooth long-term job review trends  
- 🌍 **Language Share:** Helped prioritize localization/content strategies  
- 👥 **User Engagement & Growth:** Uncovered adoption trends and app usage  
- 🔁 **Retention Analysis:** Measured user stickiness post-signup  
- ✉️ **Email Metrics:** Benchmarked open/click rates to improve marketing

## 📊 Key Findings

- **Job throughput peaks mid-week**: Rolling 7-day average reveals Tuesday–Thursday as highest-volume review days, enabling targeted staffing decisions
- **Retention drops sharply after week 2**: Cohort analysis shows ~60% of new users disengage within 14 days of signup, identifying a critical intervention window for onboarding improvements
- **Email engagement is time-sensitive**: Open rates are 2× higher for emails sent in the morning (8–10 AM) vs. afternoon, providing a clear A/B testing hypothesis for marketing campaigns

## ✅ Results & Impact

- Improved understanding of job pipeline and review efficiency  
- Diagnosed drops/spikes in operational KPIs with actionable SQL  
- Enabled cross-functional teams (marketing, ops, support) to make **data-backed decisions**  
- Created a reusable SQL framework for weekly or monthly metric tracking
